My research explores geoeconomics, trade, industrial and ESG policies. I focus on how these policies impact trade and the environment through both economic modelling and empirical work.

Beef Demand Shocks and Deforestation | Master (M2) Thesis
- Assessed the impact of foreign demand shocks on beef production and deforestation in Brazil, finding unclear direct links at the municipality level.
- Discovered that increased exports to China were fulfilled by more productive firms, while less productive firms expanded in the domestic market.
- Highlighted the need for comprehensive policies to mitigate deforestation risks, particularly in trade agreements like Mercosur-EU.

Labour Market Adjustment in the Eurozone | Master (M1) Thesis
- Investigated the role of labour mobility as an adjustment channel in response to asymmetric shocks within the EMU-12 (European Monetary Union) countries.
- Applied a Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis to assess the impact of asymmetric economic shocks on country specific employment rates, finding that mobilitiy between countries absorbs up to 92% of asymmetric shocks within five years.
