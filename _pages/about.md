I am a researcher at the French National Institute for Industrial Environment and Risks, a PhD Candidate at the University of Montpellier, France, and a member of the Center for Environmental Economics - Montpellier.

My research explores geoeconomics, trade, industrial and ESG policies. I focus on how these policies impact natural resources and the environment, specifically in the context of the clean energy transition, through both economic modelling and empirical work.
