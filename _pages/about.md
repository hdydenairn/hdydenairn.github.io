I am a doctoral researcher at [INERIS](https://www.ineris.fr/), the French National Institute for Industrial Environment and Risks, a PhD student at the [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/), and a member of the [Center for Environmental Economics - Montpellier (CEE-M)](https://www.cee-m.fr/).

My research explores trade, industrial and ESG policies. I focus on how these policies impact natural resources and the environment, specifically in the context of the clean energy transition, through both economic modelling and empirical work.
