I am a doctoral researcher at [INERIS](https://www.ineris.fr/), the French National Institute for Industrial Environment and Risks, a PhD student at the [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/), and a member of the [Center for Environmental Economics - Montpellier (CEE-M)](https://www.cee-m.fr/).

My research examines how trade and industrial policies influence natural resources and environmental outcomes and vice versa, particularly within the geoeconomic dynamics surrounding strategic goods, using both economic modeling and empirical analysis.
